# P1_Blackjack
COP3502 Project 1

The goal of this project was to simulate a simplified version of Blackjack. 

The console starts by displaying “Start game #1,” and the player is automatically dealt a card. A print menu displays, and the user will choose to get another card, hold their hand, print the statistics, or exit. If the player chooses to hold their hand, the dealer will be dealt a hand. The winner is displayed on screen
